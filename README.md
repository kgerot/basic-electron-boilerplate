# Electron Boilerplate

A *very basic* boilerplate for Electron applications using the basics: HTML/CSS/JS.

The boilerplate comes with a stylesheet that mimics some aspects of Bootstrap, but can also be completely overwritten if desired.

## Install & Launch

To install:

1. Clone the repository as desired
2. Navigate into the repository on a terminal/cmd of your choosing
3. Type `npm i` to ensure node modules are installed

To launch:

1. Type `npm start` to launch the application
